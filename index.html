    <h1>Welcome to the Baseball Ratings Project</h1>
    <p>This site will host my new player rating system, the full dataset, and the Windows app.</p>
    
    <p>
        This website has the results of a baseball simulation that ranks all MLB batters from 1876-2025. 
        The program that can be downloaded is designed to view this massive data in various helpful ways 
        (e.g., as individual years or as careers). For example, concise comparisons are made of who is in 
        the Hall of Fame and who is not. One of the conclusions is that a lot of players who had mediocre 
        careers are in the Hall; and a lot who probably should be in the Hall, are overlooked. Similarly, 
        league MVPs are open to re-examination. Who has the stats to support an MVP in the AL in 2025, 
        Judge or Raleigh? It turns out to be rather close. And then, who had the greatest single year of 
        output in MLB history? Is it Ruth, Bonds, or some third-party? It turns out to be an unknown from 
        the 19th century, Ross Barnes in 1876. A sterling player, perhaps a founding father of the MLB, 
        who deserves more attention than he has had.
